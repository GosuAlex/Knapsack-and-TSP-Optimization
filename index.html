Compulsory Assignment 1

In this assignment , we are going to solve the travelling salesman problem.
The number of cities is a graph  having 500. Each city is connected to all remaining cities. This means that a graph with 20 cities will have 19 edges.

1:  Calculate an initial solution using random method, iterative random method, and greedy method.
2:   Improve  each  starting solution using greedy improvement and greedy random algorithm.
3:  Run you algorithm  with 50 , 100, 250, 500 cities. What are your conclusions.
